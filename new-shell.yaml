    This flow runs a simple Shell command in a Cloud Run container.


    The `containerImage` property is required because Cloud Run executes tasks
    as containers. You can use any image from a public or private registry.


    Your service account needs to have the following IAM roles attached to use
    the service:

    - Cloud Run Developer

    - Logs Viewer

    - Storage Admin (to upload files to GCS and download files from GCS)

    - Owner/Editor of the Compute Engine default service account (to be able to
    provision compute resources for the Cloud Run container)
