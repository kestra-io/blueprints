    To connect to Google Sheets, follow these steps:


    - **Enable Google Sheets API:** If not done already, enable the Google
    Sheets API from the Google Cloud Console.

    - **Create Service Account** & Download the Key:
        - Navigate to IAM & Admin â†’ Service Accounts in Google Cloud Console.
        - Create a new service account and download the JSON key.
    - **Share Sheet:** Open the Google Sheet and share it with the email address
    of the service account.


    Then, make sure to add the the contents of the Service Account to the
    `serviceAccount` property.


    Here is how to find the Spreadsheet ID:

    The flow performs the following tasks:

    1. Reads the Google Sheet and stores the results in Kestra's internal
    storage (store: true).

    2. The file in the internal storage is then converted into a CSV file.

    3. The CSV file is loaded into BigQuery.
