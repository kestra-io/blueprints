  title: Extract and transform a Parquet file using DuckDB and export it in Excel
    format
  description: >-
    This flow will extract a Parquet file from a remote location, transform it
    using DuckDB and export it in Excel format.

    The Parquet file is a dataset of 4.5 million items from a fictional
    e-commerce store.

    Because Excel has a limit of roughly 1 million rows, we will limit the
    number of query results to 1 million rows in order to export it in Excel
    format.
