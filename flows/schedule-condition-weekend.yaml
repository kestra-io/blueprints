  title: Executes flow on schedule trigger with Weekend condition
  description: |
    This trigger executes the flow at 11am every day with the schedule condition that the 
    trigger date should fall on a weekend, i.e. either on a Saturday or a Sunday.

    With the Weenkend condition, you can enforce the condition for the flow to execute 
    only on a weekend.
