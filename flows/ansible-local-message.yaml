  title: Ansible 101, How to Orchestrate and Run a Simple Ansible Playbook
  description: |
    This beginner-friendly workflow demonstrates the **fundamentals of running
    Ansible playbooks** using Kestra, making it ideal for learning and onboarding
    use cases.

    It shows how to:

    1. Define an Ansible inventory inline and target local hosts using a local
       connection.
    2. Execute a simple Ansible playbook to validate orchestration and execution
       mechanics.
    3. Run Ansible tasks locally without requiring remote infrastructure or
       cloud resources.
    4. Use Kestra as an orchestration layer to trigger, observe, and manage
       Ansible executions.
    5. Build a foundation for more advanced Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
       workflows.

    This flow is perfect for **Ansible beginners**, **DevOps onboarding**,
    **demos**, and **proofs of concept** that introduce Ansible automation in a
    simple, controlled environment.
