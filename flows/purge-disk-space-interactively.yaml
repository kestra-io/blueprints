  title: Interactively purge logs, executions, and internal storage files to free up disk space
  description: |
    This flow helps manage storage by purging logs, executions, metrics, and stored files 
    based on user-defined inputs.

    - Users specify a start and end date, as well as the types of data to purge (logs, executions, metrics, or internal storage).
    - The flow contains multiple purge tasks, one per type of data.
    - A safeguard is in place requiring users to confirm destructive actions by typing "ALLOW."
    
    Note that purged data cannot be recovered, so use this flow with caution.
