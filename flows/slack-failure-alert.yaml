  title: Failure notifications to Slack to monitor the health of production workflows
  description: |
    This flow sends a Slack alert any time a flow from the `company.analytics`
    namespace finishes with errors or warnings. Thanks to the `executionId`
    variable, the alert includes a link to the failed flow's execution page.

    Given that this flow runs on a Flow trigger, there is no need for
    boilerplate code to define alert logic in each flow separately. Instead, the
    Flow trigger allows you to define that logic only once. The trigger will
    listen to the execution state of any flow in the `company.analytics`
    namespace, including all child namespaces, and will automatically send Slack
    messages on failure.

    This flow assumes that you stored the Slack webhook URL as a secret.
