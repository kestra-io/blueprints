  title: Extract a CSV file via HTTP API and upload it to S3 by using scheduled
    date as a filename
  description: >
    This flow shows how to extract a CSV file from an HTTP API and upload it to
    S3. The flow is triggered every hour, and the uploaded file is named after
    the trigger date. The flow uses the [Global Power Plant
    Database](https://datasets.wri.org/dataset/globalpowerplantdatabase) as an
    example, but you can replace the URL with any other file accessible via an
    HTTP API call.
