  title: Run a Shell script on Google Cloud with Cloud Run
  description: |
    This flow runs a simple Shell command in a Cloud Run container.

    The `containerImage` property is required because Cloud Run executes tasks
    as containers. You can use any image from a public or private registry.

    Your service account needs to have the following IAM roles attached to use
    the service:
    - Cloud Run Developer
    - Logs Viewer
    - Storage Admin (to upload files to GCS and download files from GCS)
    - Owner/Editor of the Compute Engine default service account (to be able to
    provision compute resources for the Cloud Run container)
