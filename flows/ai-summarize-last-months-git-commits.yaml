  This Kestra flow provides an automated, weekly summary of Git commit activity for a specified repository and branch. Every Friday at 3 PM UTC, it:

    - Clones the target Git repository (default: main branch)
    - Fetches all commits from the last 7 days
    - Uses OpenAI to generate a plain-text summary of the week’s changes
    - Posts the update to a Slack channel via webhook

  The flow is configurable for any repository and branch, and is suitable for both public and private repositories (with proper secrets). This ensures all stakeholders receive a concise, human-readable recap of project progress each week, directly in Slack.

    The flow is configurable for any repository and branch, and is suitable for both public and private repositories (with proper secrets). This ensures all stakeholders receive a concise, human-readable recap of project progress each week, directly in Slack.

    **Configuration:**
      - Add secrets for the Slack incoming webhook URL, OpenAI API key, and GitHub credentials if needed.
      - Change the repository URL and branch as needed.
      - For public repositories, no credentials are needed.
      - For private repositories, supply GitHub Personal Access Token via Kestra secrets.
      - Modify the schedule by adjusting the CRON expression.

    This automation keeps teams and stakeholders up-to-date on weekly development activity without manual status reporting.
