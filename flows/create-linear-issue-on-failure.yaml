  title: Create an issue in Linear when a workflow fails
  description: |
    This system flow will create an issue in Linear anytime a workflow in a
    `company` namespace (or any nested child namespace) fails. 

    Using this pattern, you can track your Kestra workflow execution incidents
    alongside other issues in Linear.

    You can customize that system flow by modifying the task, adding more tasks
    to the flow or adjusting the trigger conditions. Read more about that
    pattern in the [Administrator
    Guide](https://kestra.io/docs/administrator-guide/monitoring).

    Let's create a flow in the namespace with prefix `company` that will always
    fail.

    ```yaml
    id: failure_flow
    namespace: company.team

    tasks:
      - id: always_fails
        type: io.kestra.plugin.core.execution.Fail
    ```

    Whenever you run the `failure_flow` flow, it will fail. This will result in
    the triggering of the `create_linear_issue_on_failure` flow, and it will
    create the issue in Linear describing the failed flow by its execution ID
    and start date.
