  title: Allow failure of a group of tasks
  description: >-
    This flow demonstrates how to use the `AllowFailure` task to allow a task to
    fail without blocking downstream tasks.

    The `AllowFailure` task is useful if you don't want to block downstream
    tasks when a specific task fails.

    In this example, the task `fail_silently` will fail, but the flow will
    continue to run and the task `print_to_console` will run.

    The task `will_never_run` will never run because the task `fail` will block
    downstream tasks after failure.
