  title: Run a Python script on AWS ECS Fargate with AWS Batch
  description: |
    This flow will execute a Python script on AWS ECS Fargate. This requires you
    to setup AWS Batch, S3 Bucket in the same region that you want to run AWS
    Batch Jobs and AWS credentials.


    In order to support `inputFiles`, `namespaceFiles`, and `outputFiles`, the
    AWS Batch task runner currently relies on multi-containers ECS jobs and
    creates three containers for each job:
    - A before-container that uploads input files to S3.
    - The main container that fetches input files into the `{{ workingDir }}`
    directory and runs the task.
    - An after-container that fetches output files using outputFiles to make
    them available from the Kestra UI for download and preview.

    Since we don't know the working directory of the container in advance, we
    always need to explicitly define the working directory and output directory
    when using the AWS Batch runner, e.g. use cat `{{ workingDir }}/myFile.txt`
    rather than `cat myFile.txt`.
