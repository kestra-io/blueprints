  title: Create a ticket in Zendesk when a workflow fails
  description: |
    This system flow will create a ticket in Zendesk anytime a workflow in a
    `company` namespace (or any nested child namespace) fails. 

    Using this pattern, you can track your Kestra workflow execution incidents
    alongside other tickets in Zendesk.

    You can customize that system flow by modifying the task, adding more tasks
    to the flow or adjusting the trigger conditions. Read more about that
    pattern in the [Administrator
    Guide](https://kestra.io/docs/administrator-guide/monitoring).

    Let's create a flow in the namespace with prefix `company` that will always
    fail.

    ```yaml
    id: failure_flow
    namespace: company.team

    tasks:
      - id: always_fails
        type: io.kestra.plugin.core.execution.Fail
    ```

    Whenever you run the `failure_flow`, it will trigger an execution of the
    `create_zendesk_ticket_on_failure` flow. As a result, a new ticket will be
    created in Zendesk helping you track failed workflows interacting with
    customer data alongside other customer tickets.
