  title: Executes flow on flow trigger with ExecutionFlow condition
  description: |
    This flow trigger executes the flow based on the ExecutionFlow condition. 
    When the flow with `flowId` and `namespace` assigned in the ExecutionFlow enters the 
    state specified under the `states` attribute, this flow will get triggered.

    In this case, when the flow `system_flow` in the namespace `system.prod` 
    defined in the ExecutionFlow condition enters the `RUNNING` state as defined 
    in the `states` attribute, this flow will get triggered.

    With ExecutionFlow condition, you can enforce the condition on flow trigger that 
    is based on another flow.
