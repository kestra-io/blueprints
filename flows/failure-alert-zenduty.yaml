  title: Set up alerts for failed workflow executions using Zenduty
  description: >
    This system flow will help you set up alerts for failed workflow executions.
    Using this pattern, you can manage alerts on failure in one place.

    This flow sends an alert to Zenduty whenever a flow execution fails.

    ## Setup

    The only required input is an [integration
    key](https://docs.zenduty.com/docs/api). The API integration will send an
    API call that follows the format: 

    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://www.zenduty.com/api/events/[integration-key]/ -H
    'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"alert_type":"critical",
    "message":"Some message", "summary":"some summary",
    "entity_id":"some_entity_id"}'
    ```

    The `message` and `summary` parameters are required. The `alert_type`
    parameter is the severity of the issue, including `info`, `warning`,
    `error`, or `critical`. The default value is `error`.

    The `ZendutyExecution` task abstracts away raw API calls and only requires
    the integration key, which you can store as a
    [Secret](https://kestra.io/docs/concepts/secret). Visit the Zenduty [Events
    API documentation](https://apidocs.zenduty.com/#tag/Events) for more
    details.

    ## Customization

    You can further customize that system flow by modifying the
    `ZendutyExecution` task, or by adding more tasks to the flow.

    ## Restricting alerts using conditions

    You can restrict the flow to only send alerts for specific namespaces by
    adding an `ExecutionNamespaceCondition` to the trigger. You can read more
    about that in the [Administrator
    Guide](https://kestra.io/docs/administrator-guide/monitoring).
