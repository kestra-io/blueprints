  title: Extract data from a CSV file, load it in batch to Weaviate and query it
    with GraphQL
  description: |
    This flow shows how to extract data from a CSV file using the HTTP API, load
    it to a Weaviate cluster and query it with GraphQL.

    This flow assumes that you have a [Weaviate
    cluster](https://console.weaviate.cloud/) running, and that you created an
    API key. Make sure to replace the `url` and `apiKey` values in the tasks
    with your Weaviate credentials. It's recommended to use Secrets to store
    your API key.

    Once you've configured the Weaviate secret, you can reproduce this flow
    without any changes. It will load the data from the Kaggle Jeopardy dataset
    to Weaviate, and then query it with GraphQL.
