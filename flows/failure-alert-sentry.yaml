  title: Send an alert to Sentry when any flow fails in the company namespace
  description: |
    This flow shows how to send an alert to Sentry when a flow fails. The only
    required input is a DSN string value, which you can find when you go to your
    Sentry project settings and go to the section "Client Keys (DSN)". For more
    detailed description of how to find your DSN, visit the [following Sentry
    documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-basics/concepts/dsn-explainer/#where-to-find-your-dsn).

    You can customize the alert `payload`, which is a JSON object. For more
    information about the payload, check the [Sentry Event Payloads
    documentation](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/event-payloads/).

    The `level` parameter is the severity of the issue. The task documentation
    lists all available options including `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`,
    `FATAL`. The default value is `ERROR`.

    This monitoring flow is triggered anytime a flow fails in the `prod`
    namespace. You can fully customize the [trigger
    conditions](https://kestra.io/plugins/core#conditions).
