  Hello World – This flow is a simple example of a Kestra flow. It takes a user
  input and logs a welcome message.

  The flow has three tasks:

  1. The first task outputs two values.
  2. The second task runs a shell command and returns a value.
  3. The third task logs a welcome message using the values from the first and
  second tasks.

  Finally, the flow has a Schedule trigger that runs the flow every day at 9 o'clock, the trigger is disabled.
