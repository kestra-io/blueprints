  title: Send custom events from your application to AWS EventBridge
  description: |
    This flow will send one or more events to the specified event bus on AWS
    EventBridge. 

    The events can be sent as a JSON file or as a list of maps (dictionaries).
    For simple use cases, the map syntax is the easiest to get started. However,
    if your application already emits events in the same format as required by
    the AWS CLI and API, you can extract JSON data in one task and pass it to
    the AWS EventBridge `PutEvents` task — just make sure to convert JSON file
    to the ION format, as this is a format expected by the task to allow
    row-by-row processing.
