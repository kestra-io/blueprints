  title: Executes flow on schedule trigger with Or condition
  description: |
    This trigger executes the flow at 11am every day with the schedule condition that the 
    trigger date should either fall on a Monday or a Thursday. In other words, the flow 
    will get executed only on Mondays and Thursdays.

    With Or condition, you can put multiple conditions of which at least one should 
    evaluate to true for the flow to be executed on the trigger.
