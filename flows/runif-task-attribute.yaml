  title: Run the task based on runIf condition
  description: |
    This workflow will only run `step2` if the input `run_everything`
    is set to `true`. This allows you to build a workflow where you 
    can decide to run all of it or specific parts based on inputs.

    Using `runIf` task attribute is recommended over the 
    [If](https://kestra.io/plugins/core/tasks/flow/io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.if) 
    task when you have only have one task that needs to be run based on this condition.

    The workflow also uses a schedule that sets the input to `true`. This is a good
    way to have the schedule run different parts of the workflow, or have 
    a debug mode that you only use when executing the flow manually.
