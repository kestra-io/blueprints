  title: Set up alerts for failed workflow executions using Sentry
  description: >
    This system flow will help you set up alerts for failed workflow executions.
    Using this pattern, you can manage alerts on failure in one place.

    This flow sends an alert to Sentry whenever a flow execution fails.

    ## Setup

    To configure the alert, you need to get the DSN string value. Navigate to
    your [Sentry project
    settings](https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-basics/concepts/dsn-explainer/#where-to-find-your-dsn)
    and go to the section "Client Keys (DSN)". 

    Copy the DSN string value and store it as a
    [secret](https://kestra.io/docs/concepts/secret) in Kestra. 

    ## Customization

    You can further customize that system flow by modifying the `SentryExecution` task, or by
    adding more tasks to the flow.

    You can [customize](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/event-payloads/) the
    alert `payload`, which is a JSON object. 

    The `level` parameter is the severity of the issue. The task documentation
    lists all available options including `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`,
    `FATAL`. The default value is `ERROR`.

    ## Restricting alerts using conditions

    You can restrict the flow to only send alerts for specific namespaces by
    adding an `ExecutionNamespaceCondition` to the trigger. You can read more
    about that in the [Administrator
    Guide](https://kestra.io/docs/administrator-guide/monitoring).
