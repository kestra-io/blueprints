  # Flow Description
  **Use case:** Compact data engineering pipeline that filters product data and aggregates it by brand.
  **Highlights:**
  - Download product JSON from a public API.
  - Run a Python transform that keeps only the requested columns and emits a cleaned file.
  - Query the cleaned data with DuckDB to compute average prices per brand and store the result for download in the UI.

  title: Getting started with Kestra — a Data Engineering Pipeline example
  description: |
    This flow is a simple example of a Kestra flow used for a data engineering
    use case. It downloads a JSON file, filters the data, and calculates the
    average price per brand.

    The flow has three tasks:
    1. The first task downloads a JSON file.
    2. The second task filters the data and writes it to a new JSON file.
    3. The third task reads the filtered data, calculates the average price per
    brand using DuckDB, and stores the result as a Kestra output which can be
    previewed and downloaded from the UI.
