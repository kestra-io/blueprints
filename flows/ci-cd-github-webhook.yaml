  title: CI/CD with a GitHub webhook trigger in production and a manually-supplied
    JSON-type input for local testing
  description: |
    This flow can be used as a template to implement a CI/CD pipeline that
    processes event payload from a GitHub webhook trigger. In this example, any
    time you open a new Pull Request, the flow will be triggered and the flow
    will use the payload information to implement custom actions. Here, we
    simply add a comment to the pull request using the Pull Request's comment
    URL from the event payload, but your use case might require retrieving
    information such as branch name, etc.  

    To facilitate local testing, the expression `'{{
    trigger.body.pull_request.comments_url ??
    inputs.payload.pull_request.comments_url }}'` will make sure that the flow
    uses a value from the webhook if the flow is triggered via a webhook, and
    will otherwise use the value from a manually provided input e.g. [a JSON
    payload](https://gist.github.com/anna-geller/54c999b3b2ba3647223618f8c657910f).
    This way, you can test the workflow end-to-end using a mock data provided as
    a JSON-type input before testing it with live data from a webhook.
