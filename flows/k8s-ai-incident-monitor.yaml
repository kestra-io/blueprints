  title: Kubernetes AI-powered incident monitoring, analysis, and alerting
  description: |
    This flow continuously monitors a Kubernetes cluster for health and incidents, automatically collects resource data, and performs AI-powered analysis and alerting. It gathers pod, node, deployment, service, quota, and log data using the Kubernetes plugin. The AI task analyzes this data for incidents, root causes, affected resources, severity, and recommended remediation steps. If the incident severity is classified as HIGH, a summary is sent to a Slack channel for immediate response.

    - **Kubernetes Data Collection:** Collects resource status and recent events from the cluster, including pods, nodes, deployments, services, resource quotas, and selected logs.
    - **AI Incident Analysis:** Uses Gemini 2.5 Flash via the AI Agent plugin to summarize current cluster health, perform root cause analysis, assess impact, and recommend remediation and preventive actions.
    - **Severity Classification:** Classifies incident severity based on analysis output, using customizable keywords.
    - **Slack Notification:** Sends a summary alert to Slack if severity is HIGH.
    - **Scheduled Monitoring:** Runs every 5 minutes using a scheduled trigger.

    The flow can be adapted to target different clusters, namespaces, and resources by updating plugin defaults and resource selectors. The Slack webhook is configurable for production use.
