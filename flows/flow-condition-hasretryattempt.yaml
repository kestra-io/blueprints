  title: Executes flow on flow trigger with HasRetryAttempt condition
  description: |
    This flow trigger executes the flow based on the HasRetryAttempt condition. 
    When any flow task on retry enters the state specified in the `in` states under 
    the HasRetryAttempt condition, this flow will get triggered.

    In this case, when any flow task on retry enters the `FAILED` state as defined 
    in the `in` attribute, this flow will get triggered. This flow will send
    a slack message about the retry attempt being failed for that flowId.

    With HasRetryAttempt condition, you can enforce the condition on flow trigger that 
    is based on the the state of the task of another flow on retry.
