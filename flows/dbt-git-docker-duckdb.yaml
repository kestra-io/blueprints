    This flow runs multiple dbt commands in a single container. 

    This approach can be useful if you want to run several dbt commands and you
    want to run them all in one container to minimize latency.

    Firstly, the flow creates the working directory. Within the working
    directory, the flow contains tasks to 
    1. clone the git repository
    2. run the dbt commands in a docker container
