  title: Create GitHub issue when a workflow fails
  description: |
    This system flow will create a GitHub issue anytime a workflow in a
    `company` namespace (or any nested child namespace) fails. 

    You can customize that system flow by modifying the task, adding more tasks
    to the flow or adjusting the trigger conditions. Read more about that
    pattern in the [Administrator
    Guide](https://kestra.io/docs/administrator-guide/monitoring).

    Let's create a flow in the namespace with prefix `company` that will always
    fail.


    ```yaml
    id: failure_flow
    namespace: company.team

    tasks:
      - id: always_fails
        type: io.kestra.plugin.core.execution.Fail
    ```

    Whenever you run the `failure_flow`, it will trigger an execution of the
    `create_github_issue_on_failure` flow. As a result, a GitHub issue will be
    created so that an appropriate action can be taken.
