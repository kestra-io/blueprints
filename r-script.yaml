  title: Run R script in a Docker container and output downloadable artifacts
  description: >-
    This flow runs R script in a working directory. It loads data, analyzes it
    using the `dplyr` package. Finally, it stores the result as  both CSV and
    Parquet files, which both can be downloaded from the Execution Outputs tab.


    The R script is executed in a Docker container, providing isolated
    environment for the task and avoiding any dependency conflicts. All
    dependencies for the task are baked into a publicly available Docker image,
    maintained by Kestra: `ghcr.io/kestra-io/rdata:latest`. You can replace that
    image with your own, or install custom dependencies at runtime using the
    `beforeCommands` property, for example:


    ```

    beforeCommands:
        - Rscript -e "install.packages(c('httr', 'RSQLite'))" > /dev/null 2>&1
    ```
