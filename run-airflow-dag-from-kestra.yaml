  title: Trigger an Apache Airflow DAG run from Kestra and wait for its completion
  description: >-
    This flow triggers an Airflow DAG run using Kestra's Airflow plugin and
    waits for its completion. Under the hood, the plugin uses the Airflow REST
    API to trigger the DAG run and check its status.

    The `conf` field in the request body can be used to pass extra metadata
    about the execution that triggered the Airflow DAG run. 

    The flow can be useful for users migrating to Kestra from Airflow or
    orchestrating workflows across both platforms.
