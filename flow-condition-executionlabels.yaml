  title: Executes flow on flow trigger with ExecutionLabels condition
  description: >-
    This flow trigger executes the flow based on the ExecutionLabels condition. 
    When any flow with the labels as specified under the `labels` in the ExecutionLabels 
    condition enters into the state specified under the `states` attribute, this flow 
    will get triggered.

    In this case, when any flow with label `owner: john.doe` enters the `FAILED` state as 
    defined in the `states` attribute, this flow will get triggered. This flow will send an 
    email about the flow execution that has failed, and in turn resulted in the triggering 
    of this flow.

    With ExecutionLabels condition, you can enforce the condition on flow trigger that 
    is based on labels of another flow.
