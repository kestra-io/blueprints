  title: Run a Python script and generate outputs, metrics and files specified with a variable
  description: >-
    This flow generates a CSV file with 100 random orders and then calculates
    the sum and average of the "total" column. It then reports the results as
    outputs and metrics. 

    The CSV file generated by a Python task is set as `outputFiles`, allowing
    you to download the file from the UI's Execution page. It is helpful to
    share the results of your workflow with business stakeholders who can
    download the file from the UI and use it in their processes.

    To avoid hardcoding values, the filename `orders.csv` is specified as a
    variable.
