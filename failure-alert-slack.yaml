  title: Set up alerts for failed workflow executions using Slack
  description: >
    This system flow will help you set up alerts for failed workflow executions.
    Using this pattern, you can manage alerts on failure in one place.

    Here, we send a message to a Slack channel when any workflow execution
    fails. 

    You can further customize that system flow by modifying the `SlackExecution`
    task, or by adding more tasks to the flow.

    Additionally, you can restrict the flow to only send alerts for specific
    namespaces by adding an `ExecutionNamespaceCondition` to the trigger. You
    can read more about that in the [Administrator
    Guide](https://kestra.io/docs/administrator-guide/monitoring).
