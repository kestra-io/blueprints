  title: Send a Discord message when a production workflow fails
  description: >-
    This flow implements a namespace-level monitoring for all workflows in the
    namespace `company.analytics`. Whenever an execution in that namespace
    fails, this flow will automatically send a message to a Discord channel.
    This means that you don't need any boilerplate code to implement alerting
    logic. You only need to implement that once and thanks to the Flow trigger,
    Kestra will make sure that all executions matching the conditions will
    receive notifications.


    To use this flow, you need to create a Discord webhook and store it as a
    Secret. Follow this [guide on
    Discord](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks)
    to create a webhook.
