  title: Automate tasks on AWS using the AWS CLI
  description: >-
    This flow demonstrates how you can use the AWS CLI plugin to automate
    various tasks on AWS. 


    The task `aws` below runs two commands. They both list ECS clusters in the
    region `us-east-1` using the `aws ecs list-clusters` command. The output is
    a JSON array of cluster ARNs. 

    1. The first task uses the `--query` parameter to filter the output to only
    show the cluster ARNs. 

    2. The second task stores the output to a file called `output.json`, making
    it available for further processing or download.


    This flow assumes AWS credentials stored as secrets `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and
    `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
