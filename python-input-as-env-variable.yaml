  title: Run a Python command that can takes an input using an environment variable
  description: >-
    This workflow passes the input as an environment variable to the Python code. 
    The `code` task, which is the python `Commands` task, has the `env` property 
    that sets the environment variables. The value of these environment variables 
    can be based on the inputs. The `main.py` file that gets executed using the 
    python commands task can then use these environment variables which contain 
    the inputs.

    For this workflow, the `main.py` file will have the following code:
    
    ```python
    import requests
    import os
    
    # Perform the GET request
    response = requests.get(os.environ['URI'])
    
    # Check if the request was successful
    if response.status_code == 200:
        # Print the content of the page
        print(response.text)
    else:
        print(f"Failed to retrieve the webpage. Status code: {response.status_code}")
    ``` 

    Notice how the python code uses the `URI` environment variable.
