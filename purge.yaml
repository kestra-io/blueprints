  title: Purge execution data including logs, metrics and outputs on a schedule
  description: >
    This flow will [purge all execution
    data](https://kestra.io/plugins/core/tasks/execution/io.kestra.plugin.core.execution.PurgeExecutions)
    older than 1 month, including logs, metrics and outputs. In this specific
    flow, we chose to purge only the successful executions in order to keep the
    audit trail of failed executions. However, you can leave the `states` field
    empty to purge all execution data, regardless of the execution status, or
    adjust it to your needs.


    Given that logs often consistute the largest chunk of data that needs to be
    purged, we use a dedicated task to purge logs (so that you can run it
    independently or rerun only this step in case something fails). Keep in mind
    though that, by default, the `PurgeExecutions` task would also automatically
    purge the logs.


    It is recommended to run this flow daily to keep your Kestra instance clean
    and save storage space.


    **Before using this flow, make sure to set the `disabled` property to false
    (or remove that line entirely).**


    Note that this flow will not purge the flow definitions or the namespace
    files â€” your code will be safe. Only the execution-related data will be
    purged.
