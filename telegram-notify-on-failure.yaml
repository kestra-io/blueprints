  title: Send a Telegram notification when a workflow fails
  description: >-
    This system flow will send a Telegram notification anytime a workflow in a
    `company` namespace (or any nested child namespace) fails. 


    Using this pattern, you can send Telegram notifications for Kestra workflow
    execution failures alongside other notifications.


    You can customize that system flow by modifying the task, adding more tasks
    to the flow or adjusting the trigger conditions. Read more about that
    pattern in the [Administrator
    Guide](https://kestra.io/docs/administrator-guide/monitoring).


    Let's create a flow in the namespace with prefix `company` that will always
    fail.


    ```yaml

    id: failure_flow

    namespace: company.team


    tasks:
      - id: always_fails
        type: io.kestra.plugin.core.execution.Fail
    ```


    Whenever you run the `failure_flow`, it will trigger an execution of the
    `telegram_notify_on_failure` flow. As a result, a Telegram notification will
    be sent so that prompt action can be taken.
