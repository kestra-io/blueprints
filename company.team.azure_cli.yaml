  title: Automate tasks on Azure using Azure CLI
  description: >-
    This flow demonstrates how you can use the Azure CLI plugin to automate
    various tasks on Azure. The task below runs a simple command to list Azure
    regions using the `az account list-locations` command. The output is a JSON
    array of region names â€” you can either output that result to a JSON file or
    use the `--query` parameter to only show the region names.


    While the example shown below is simple, the CLI allows you to automate
    virtually anything. Every action in Azure can be performed via an API call
    that you can trigger from the CLI. For instance, you can follow the [Azure
    documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-quickstart)
    to start containers on Azure. Azure Container Instances support both CPU and
    GPU workloads, and all that can be orchestrated with this simple CLI task.
