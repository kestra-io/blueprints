  description: >-
    In this blueprint, we upload a file to Google Drive.


    > Note: The `parents` property here refers to an existing Google Drive
    directory. To be able to use Google Drive you will have to enable the API in
    your Google Cloud Platform project and share the folder with your service
    account email address.


    Make sure to add the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable
    with a value of the path to the JSON keyfile (note this must be a path to a
    file, not the contents of the Service Account).
