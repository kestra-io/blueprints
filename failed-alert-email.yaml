  title: Set up alerts for failed workflow executions using Email
  description: >
    This system flow will help you set up alerts for failed workflow executions.
    Using this pattern, you can manage alerts on failure in one place.

    This flow sends an email alert whenever a flow execution fails.

    ## Restricting alerts using conditions

    You can restrict the flow to only send alerts for specific namespaces by
    adding an `ExecutionNamespaceCondition` to the trigger. You can read more
    about that in the [Administrator
    Guide](https://kestra.io/docs/administrator-guide/monitoring).
