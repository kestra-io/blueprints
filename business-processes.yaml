  title: Getting started with Kestra â€” a Business Processes workflow example
  description: >-
    This flow is a simple example of a business process automation use case for
    vacation approval.


    The user first submits a vacation request using a form automatically created
    in the Kestra UI thanks to inputs. The flow then sends a Slack message to
    request approval for a vacation, waits for the approval, and then processes
    the request. The approval is as simple as clicking on the `Resume` button in
    the Kestra UI.


    The flow has three tasks:

    1. The first task sends a Slack message to request approval for a vacation.

    2. The second task pauses the execution to wait for the approval.

    3. Once the execution is resumed, the third task processes the vacation
    request.
