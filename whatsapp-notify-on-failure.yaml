  title: Send a WhatsApp notification when a workflow fails
  description: >-
    This system flow will send a WhatsApp notification anytime a workflow in a
    `company` namespace (or any nested child namespace) fails. 

    Using this pattern, you can send WhatsApp notifications for Kestra workflow
    execution failures alongside other notifications.

    You can customize that system flow by modifying the task, adding more tasks
    to the flow or adjusting the trigger conditions. Read more about that
    pattern in the [Administrator Guide](https://kestra.io/docs/administrator-guide/monitoring).

    Let's create a flow in the namespace with prefix `company` that will always fail.

    ```yaml
    id: failure_flow
    namespace: company.team

    tasks:
      - id: always_fails
        type: io.kestra.plugin.core.execution.Fail
    ```

    Whenever you run the `failure_flow`, it will trigger an execution of the
    `whatsapp_notify_on_failure` flow. As a result, a WhatsApp notification will
    be sent so that prompt action can be taken.
