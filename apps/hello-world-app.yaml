  This Kestra App demonstrates how to create and run a simple flow execution, 
  making it ideal as a "Hello World" example for new users. 
  It provides a form to launch the flow with custom inputs, 
  displays execution progress in real time, and shows logs when the execution completes.

  The App includes:
    - **OPEN**: A form to provide inputs and start the flow
    - **RUNNING**: A live view of the execution, including logs and the option to cancel
    - **SUCCESS**: Full execution logs and a link to explore more examples

  This lightweight setup is useful for onboarding and testing, 
  helping users quickly understand how executions work in Kestra.

    A simple Kestra App that lets you launch an execution, 
    track its progress, and review logs once it completes. 

    **How it works**
      - On open, users can pass input values and start the flow
      - While running, logs and a cancel option are displayed
      - On success, the logs are shown in full and users can explore additional examples

    **Configuration:**
      - Update the `flowId` to point to any target flow in your namespace
      - Customize the form inputs to match your flow requirements
      - Adjust success or failure messages for your use case

    This App is a good starting point for experimenting with executions, 
    and can be extended with additional states or UI blocks as needed.
