description: |
  This Kestra App displays the outputs of a specific past execution (`get_data` flow, executionId `RlLf9YLa9PUka7zlFlK1X`). 
  It is designed for situations where you want to share or surface the results of a completed execution 
  â€” for example, a generated report, dataset, or other downloadable artifact.

  When the past execution has succeeded, the app shows:
    - A custom markdown block with instructions or context for the user
    - The execution outputs, which may include download links, JSON objects, or other artifacts depending on the flow

  The app is set to `PUBLIC` access, making the results viewable without authentication.

  title: Public App for displaying outputs from a past execution
  description: |
    This Kestra App makes it easy to share outputs from a completed execution with external users or stakeholders. 
    It references a specific flow (`get_data`) and a fixed execution ID, rendering the results as a simple app page.

    **How it works**
      - The app loads a specific past execution by `executionId`
      - On successful execution, it displays a markdown block (customizable) and an `Outputs` block
      - Outputs can include files, structured data, or other artifacts generated by the flow

    **Configuration:**
      - Replace the `flowId` and `executionId` values to point to the execution you want to expose
      - Adjust the markdown block to provide user-friendly instructions (e.g., download a report, review metrics)
      - Set access type to `PUBLIC` or restrict as needed

    This pattern is useful for sharing generated reports, audit logs, or any reusable execution outputs without rerunning the flow.

    **Connected Flow**
    
    ```yaml
    id: get_data

    inputs:
      - id: data
        displayName: Select data to download
        type: SELECT
        values: [customers, employees, products, stores, suppliers]
        defaults: customers

      - id: startDate
        displayName: Start date for your dataset
        type: DATE
        defaults: 2024-12-03

    tasks:

        uri: https://huggingface.co/datasets/kestra/datasets/resolve/main/ion/{{ inputs.data }}.ion

    outputs:
