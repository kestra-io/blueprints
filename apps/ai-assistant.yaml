  This Kestra App provides an AI-powered assistant to support user research. 
  It allows researchers to submit context about users and receive recommended 
  answers generated by large language models (LLMs). 

  The App guides the workflow through:
    - **OPEN**: A form where researchers provide user context
    - **RUNNING**: A progress state showing that the AI is generating responses
    - **SUCCESS**: Display of AI-generated recommendations with logs filtered 
      to show only relevant task outputs

  This makes it easy to experiment with LLMs for qualitative research, 
  user interviews, or survey analysis, all within Kestra.

  title: AI Assistant for User Research
  description: |
    This App leverages AI models to recommend answers based on user-provided context. 
    It is designed for teams conducting user research who want quick, 
    contextualized recommendations to support decision-making. 

    **How it works**
      - On open, the researcher provides user context
      - While running, the App shows a live progress indicator
      - On success, the App displays filtered logs containing only the AIâ€™s responses

    **Configuration:**
      - Set the `flowId` to point to your LLM-powered flow
      - Ensure required secrets (e.g., AI provider API keys) are available in Kestra
      - Adjust log filters (`taskIds`) to match the tasks producing AI outputs

    This App helps user research teams quickly generate insights, 
    without manually parsing full execution logs.
