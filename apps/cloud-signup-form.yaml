          We will notify you as soon as we launch.

          This Kestra App exposes a public signup form for the Kestra Cloud waitlist. It:

          - Displays introductory markdown with call-to-action
          - Renders an execution-backed form tied to a flow (`kestra_cloud_form`)
          - Submits the form to create a new execution
          - Shows a confirmation message after submission

          The app is publicly accessible (`access: PUBLIC`) and is intended to collect interest and route submissions
          through a dedicated flow. Customize the markdown, form inputs (via the target flow’s inputs), and confirmation
          text to match your onboarding process.

    A simple, public-facing Kestra App that collects waitlist signups for Kestra Cloud and creates an execution
    of a designated flow (`kestra_cloud_form`) on submission.

    **How it works**
      - On open: shows marketing copy and a form tied to a flow (via `CreateExecutionForm`)
      - On submit: triggers a new execution of the target flow
      - On created: confirms submission with a thank-you message

    **Configuration:**
      - Ensure the target flow (`flowId`) exists and defines the inputs you want to collect in the form.
      - Adjust `namespace`, `displayName`, and `access` to fit your environment.
      - Customize markdown blocks to reflect your brand and messaging.
      - Optionally add or reorder blocks (e.g., additional Markdown, links, or guidance).

    This App pattern is suitable for lightweight, public data capture workflows that funnel submissions into
    Kestra executions for downstream processing and notifications.
