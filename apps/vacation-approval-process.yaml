  This Kestra App manages vacation approval requests through a structured workflow.
  Employees submit their vacation details via a form, and the request pauses 
  for HR or a manager to validate and approve or reject. 

  The App includes:
    - **OPEN**: Collect and submit vacation request details
    - **RUNNING**: Display execution progress and logs
    - **PAUSE**: Allow HR or managers to review request details and employee data before approving or rejecting
    - **RESUME**: Acknowledge validation and continue execution
    - **SUCCESS**: Confirm successful request processing with logs
    - **FALLBACK**: Provide a generic completion message

  This flow ensures vacation requests are formally captured, reviewed, and documented,
  reducing manual overhead while providing transparency for both employees and HR.

    This Kestra App streamlines the vacation approval process by 
    combining employee self-service with an HR validation step.

    **How it works**
      - Employees fill out a form with their name, start date, and end date
      - The request is logged and moves into a `PAUSE` step for HR/manager review
      - Employee data is attached as a file output for reference
      - HR or a manager can approve (resuming execution) or reject the request
      - Once approved, the process completes successfully and is logged

    **Configuration:**
      - Update the `flowId` to connect with your HR workflow
      - Customize the form fields to capture more details (e.g., department, backup coverage)
      - Adjust access type (`PRIVATE` vs. `PUBLIC`) depending on your organization’s HR policy
      - Modify markdown messages for company-specific communication style

    This App helps automate vacation requests, 
    ensuring each request is approved before becoming official, 
    while providing employees with transparency and HR with governance.
