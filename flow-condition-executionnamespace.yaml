  title: Executes flow on flow trigger with ExecutionNamespace condition
  description: >-
    This flow trigger executes the flow based on the ExecutionNamespace condition. 
    When any flow within the namespace as specified under the `namespace` in the 
    ExecutionNamespace condition enters into the state specified under the `states` 
    attribute of the Flow trigger, this flow will get triggered.

    In this case, when any flow within namespace having prefix (as `comparison` 
    attribute is set to `PREFIX`) `company.engineering` enters the `FAILED` state as 
    defined in the `states` attribute, this flow will get triggered. This flow will send
    a slack message about the flow execution that has failed, and in turn resulted in 
    the triggering of this flow.

    With ExecutionNamespace condition, you can enforce the condition on flow trigger that 
    is based on the namespace of another flow.
