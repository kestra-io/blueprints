  title: Getting started with Kestra â€” a Hello World Example
  description: >-
    This flow is a simple example of a Kestra flow. It takes a user input and
    logs a welcome message.


    The flow has three tasks:

    1. The first task outputs two values.

    2. The second task runs a shell command and returns a value.

    3. The third task logs a welcome message using the values from the first and
    second tasks.


    Finally, the flow has a Schedule trigger that runs the flow every day at 9
    o'clock, the trigger is disabled.
