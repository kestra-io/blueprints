  title: Azure Blob Storage file detection event triggers upload to BigQuery and
    dbt Cloud job
  description: >-
    When a new file arrives in Azure Blob Storage, this flow processes that file
    and uploads it to BigQuery. The flow is configured to process multiple files
    in parallel if multiple files are uploaded to Azure BLOB container.


    Then, the flow runs a dbt Cloud job and waits for its completion. Kestra
    retrieves dbt Cloud job's artifacts and dynamically parses them within the
    Gantt view. This way, you can inspect how long it took to run each dbt model
    and dbt test. 


    This flow assumes that sensitive information such as Azure Connection
    string, Google Service Account, and dbt Cloud API token are stored as
    secrets. For testing, you can copy-paste those directly into the flow.

    from Azure Blob Storage to BigQuery, handles parallel uploads, triggers dbt
    Cloud jobs, and parses artifacts in a Gantt view for detailed dbt model and
    test insights."
