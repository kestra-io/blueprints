  title: Using system readOnly label to disable editing the flow from UI
  description: >-
    This workflow sets the `system.readOnly` label to `true`. This 
    makes the flow read only, and does not allow editing the flow 
    from the UI.

    Thsi helps prevent modifications to critical workflows, such as 
    production flows managed through CI/CD pipelines.
