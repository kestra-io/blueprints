  title: Executes flow on schedule trigger with TimeBetween condition
  description: >-
    This flow gets triggered on an hourly basis with the schedule condition that 
    the time falls between 8am and 5pm of +02:00 timezone using the TimeBetween 
    condition.

    The TimeBetween condition also works with either the `before` or `after` clause
    on their own. By providing only the `before` clause, the condition will evaluate to 
    true for any `date` that falls before the `before` time. Similarly, by providing
    only the `after` clause, the condition will evaluate to true for any `date` that falls 
    after the `after` time.

    By providing both the `before` and `after` time, the condition will evaluate 
    to true when the `date` falls between the `before` and the `after` time.

    The flow will only get triggered if the associated TimeBetween condition 
    evaluates to true.
