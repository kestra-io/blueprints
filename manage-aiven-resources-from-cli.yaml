  title: Manage Aiven resources from the CLI — start and stop services or
    databases on schedule
  description: >
    This flow shows how to manage Aiven resources from the CLI. It assumes that
    you have an Aiven account and that you [created an API
    token](https://docs.aiven.io/docs/platform/howto/create_authentication_token).
    Make sure to replace the `AVN_AUTH_TOKEN` value in the task with your Aiven
    API token. It's recommended to use Secrets to store sensitive data such as
    API tokens.


    Once you've configured the Aiven secret, you can reproduce this flow without
    any changes. 


    The first command is great to test the setup — the command will just list
    your Aiven projects. However, there is a lot more you can do with the Aiven
    CLI. Check out the [Aiven CLI
    guide](https://aiven.io/developer/aiven-cmdline) for more information.


    For example, you can use it to start and stop specific services in your
    Aiven projects using scheduled flows in Kestra. This is useful if you want
    to save money by stopping your services when you don't need them, e.g. at
    night or during the weekend. 


    You can also use the CLI to create and delete services or databases on
    demand.
