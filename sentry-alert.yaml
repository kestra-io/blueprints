  title: Send an alert to Sentry when a flow fails
  description: >-
    This flow shows how to send an alert to Sentry when a flow fails.


    The only required input is a DSN string value, which you can find when you
    go to your Sentry project settings and go to the section "Client Keys
    (DSN)". You can find more detailed description of how to find your DSN in
    the [following Sentry
    documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-basics/concepts/dsn-explainer/#where-to-find-your-dsn).


    You can customize the alert `payload`, which is a JSON object, or you can
    skip it and use the default payload created by kestra. For more information
    about the payload, check the [Sentry Event Payloads
    documentation](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/event-payloads/).


    The `event_id` is an optional payload attribute that you can use to override
    the default event ID. If you don't specify it (recommended), kestra will
    generate a random UUID. You can use this attribute to group events together,
    but note that this must be a UUID type. For more information, check the
    [Sentry
    documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/product/issues/grouping-and-fingerprints/).
