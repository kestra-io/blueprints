  title: Executes flow on schedule trigger with PublicHoliday condition
  description: >-
    This trigger executes the flow at 11am every day with the schedule condition that the 
    trigger date should fall on a public holiday of France, i.e. the flow will execute only 
    on public holidays in France.

    With the PublicHoliday condition, you can enforce the condition for the flow to execute 
    only on public holidays for a specific country. The PublicHoliday condition uses the 
    [Jollyday](https://github.com/focus-shift/jollyday) library for public holiday calendar 
    that supports more than 70 countries.
